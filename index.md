    Widely regarded as a barometer for equality of opportunity, intergenerational mobility has attracted renewed attention amid concerns that it has declined in the wake of rising economic inequality since the 1970s. Although earlier research documents stability, or even modest increases, in mobility among cohorts who entered the labor market before this period, evidence for more recent cohorts is limited and inconsistent. In this study, we analyze contemporary trends in class mobility using a new approach based on the "synthetic dynasties" represented in Markov chains. This approach yields several novel measures of movement and memory, which respectively capture how class positions differ from one generation to the next and how the influence of class origins dissipates across generations. Applying these methods to data from the U.S., we find that overall levels of movement and memory have remained largely stable across cohorts born between 1945 and 1990. This stability, however, masks offsetting class-specific trends. Among those from the upper and lower classes, movement has declined and memory has increased. In contrast, among the middle classes, movement has risen and memory has weakened.

    <details style="text-align: justify;">
    <summary style="list-style: disclosure-closed inside; display: list-item;"><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
    This paper examines intergenerational mobility in China and Russia during their transitions from central planning to market systems. We consider mobility as movement captured by changes in status between parents and children. We provide estimates of overall mobility, which involves mobility during transition to a system's steady state, as well as steady state mobility, which captures long-run mobility independent of transitional dynamics or shifts in the marginal distribution of outcomes across generations. We further decompose overall mobility into structural and exchange components. We find that China exhibits more overall educational mobility than Russia mostly due to greater structural mobility, while Russia exhibits greater steady state educational mobility. In contrast, both the overall and steady state occupational mobility is similar in China and Russia. Comparing these results to the US, we find that steady state mobility in education is substantially higher in the US and Russia compared to China, but occupational steady state mobility is comparable in all three countries.
