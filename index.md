1.  **Butaeva, K.**, Chen, L., Durlauf, S. N., & Park, A. (2025). *A Tale of Two Transitions: Mobility Dynamics in China and Russia after Central Planning*.  
    **Abstract:** This paper examines intergenerational mobility in China and Russia during their transitions from central planning to market systems. We consider mobility as movement captured by changes in status between parents and children. We provide estimates of overall mobility, which involves mobility during transition to a system's steady state, as well as steady state mobility, which captures long-run mobility independent of transitional dynamics or shifts in the marginal distribution of outcomes across generations. We further decompose overall mobility into structural and exchange components. We find that China exhibits more overall educational mobility than Russia mostly due to greater structural mobility, while Russia exhibits greater steady state educational mobility. In contrast, both the overall and steady state occupational mobility is similar in China and Russia. Comparing these results to the US, we find that steady state mobility in education is substantially higher in the US and Russia compared to China, but occupational steady state mobility is comparable in all three countries.

2.  **Butaeva, K.**, & Park, A. (2025). *ncome Inequality in Chinese Provinces: The Role of Human Capital*.  
    **Abstract:** In this paper, we conduct the first systematic empirical analysis of income inequality in China at the provincial level. Using data from the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) and a semiparametric distribution model, we estimate Gini indices for Chinese provinces in 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018. We find that differences in the "prices" and "quantities" of human capital are important factors in explaining differences in inequality between provinces. Poor provinces have higher levels of inequality because they have higher educational inequality, higher returns to schooling, and lower average educational attainment. We conclude that the reduction of existing interprovincial human capital gaps and the acceleration of labor market integration through appropriate government policies could reduce spatial disparities in inequality levels across regions and overall income inequality in China.

3.  **Butaeva, K.** (2025). *Income Inequality in China, 2012-2018: A New Measurement Approach*.  
    **Abstract:** This paper applies new measurement procedures to the data from the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) to estimate income inequality in China from 2012 to 2018. In this study, I also examine rural-urban and regional disparities in China, as well as income inequality in five provinces (Shanghai, Guangdong, Liaoning, Henan, and Gansu). The proposed estimation method aims to account for the sparse influential observations of the top income earners in the survey data and involves two main attributes. First, to approximate income distribution, I use a semiparametric density model, consisting of a nonparametric kernel density approximating the bulk and a Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) top tail. Second, to fit the parameters of the GPD, I suggest utilizing a Maximum Penalized Likelihood Estimator (MPLE) with a beta penalty function tuned to model the top income distribution. The results yield estimates of the Gini index in China of 0.616 in 2012, 0.604 in 2014, 0.581 in 2016, and 0.590 in 2018. These estimates are higher than those obtained by applying the same estimation procedures to the data from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) in a supplementary analysis in this paper. Nevertheless, the results are consistent with the Gini index estimates from the previous literature that relied on top income adjustments. Moreover, they are substantially higher than typical estimates, which are solely based on the household survey data.
